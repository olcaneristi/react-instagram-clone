# Welcome!

### I developed an Instagram web app clone with React + SASS to improve myself.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## [Live Demo]()

#### Install deps

```bash
$ npm install
#or
$ yarn install
```

#### In the project directory, run the development server::

```bash
$ npm run dev
#or
$ yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
